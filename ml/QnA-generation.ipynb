      "increased rates of nutrient and chemical leaching. Infiltration\n",
      "rate should at least match that of the surface soil.\n",

      "1.4 Components of Laser Land Levelling System\n",
      "\n",
      "The laser levelling involves the use of laser transmitter, that\n",
      "emits a rapidly rotating beam parallel to the required field\n",
      "plane, which is picked up by a sensor (receiving unit) fitted\n",
      "to a tractor towards the scraper unit. The signal received is\n",

      "linkage mounted on or pulled by the tractor. Pull type system\n",
      "is preferred as it is easier to connect the tractor’s hydraulic\n",
      "system to an external hydraulic ram than connectting to the\n",
      "internal control system used by the 3-point–linkage system.\n",
      "Bucket dimensions and capacity will vary according to the\n",
      "available power source and field conditions. A 60 H.P. tractor\n",
      "can pull a 2m wide × 1m deep bucket in most soil types. The\n",

      "receiver mounts on a manual or electric mast attached to\n",
      "the drag bucket. It is mounted on the scraper. A set of\n",

      "1.4.5 Hydraulic Control System: The hydraulic system of the\n",

      "normally delivered at 2000-3000 psi (Fig. 1.7). As the hydraulic\n",

      "ram. When connected as a single acting ram only one oil line\n",

      "non-working side of the ram. In this configuration, the weight\n",

      "speed. The faster the ground speed the faster the bucket will\n",
      "need to adjust. The rate at which the bucket will raise and\n",
      "lower is dependent on the amount of oil supplied to the\n",

      "Conventional System/Small Rotary Sprinklers\n",
      "Small size lateral pipes are placed on riser pipes fixed at\n",
      "uniform interval along the length of lateral pipes. The sprinkler\n",

      "suspended from a portable tower. The large sprinkler irrigates\n",

      "one farms unless there are additional plants.\n",
      "\n",
      "●\n",
      "Semi Permanent System: A semi permanent system has\n",
      "portable lateral lines, permanent main lines and sub mains,\n",
      "and a stationary water source and pumping plant. The\n",
      "main lines and sub mains are usually buried, with riser\n",
      "for nozzle locate at suitable intervals.\n",
      "\n",
      "●\n",
      "Solid Set System: A solid set system has enough laterals\n",
      "to eliminate their movement. The laterals are positioned\n",
      "in the field early in the crop season and remain for the\n",

      "where a large amount of soil is moved and hard pans are\n",
      "removed, excessively high infiltration rate may lead to\n",
      "increased rates of nutrient and chemical leaching. Infiltration\n",
      "rate should at least match that of the surface soil.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.3.3 Cost of levelling: The initial cost of land levelling using\n",
      "tractors and scarpers is high. The cost varies according to the\n",
      "topography, the shape of the field and the equipment used.\n",
      "By and large, the cost of land levelling with laser guided\n",

      "gently sloping fields. The cost of the levelling operation is\n",
      "two to three times that of a standard tillage operation.\n",
      "\n",
      "1.4 Components of Laser Land Levelling System\n",
      "\n",

      "emits a rapidly rotating beam parallel to the required field\n",
      "plane, which is picked up by a sensor (receiving unit) fitted\n",

      "can pull a 2m wide × 1m deep bucket in most soil types. The\n",
